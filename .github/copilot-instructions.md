This is a Vite + React frontend for a crowdfunding dApp. The app should:
- Connect to the deployed CrowdFunding smart contract on Sepolia
- Allow users to view all campaigns, create a campaign, donate, and view donators
- Use ethers.js for contract interaction
- Use a modern UI framework (e.g., Material UI or Tailwind CSS)
